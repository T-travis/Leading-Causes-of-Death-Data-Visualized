# Leading-Causes-of-Death-Data-Visualized

This is a small group project for my Web Development class.  To complete this project we used: the Socrata API 
to get data on the leading causes of death from the CDC, Chart.js, MySQL, PHP, JavaScript, jQuery, Ajax, HTML, and CSS.  Below is an example of using the app.
